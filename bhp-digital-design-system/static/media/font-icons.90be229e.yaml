  We are promoting the use of [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free). These free font icons are open-source and created to depict in simple and minimal forms the universal concepts used commonly throughout a user interface.

  In some cases (design need or topical icons) [Material Design font icons](https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/) can be used as a secondary option.

  When you have to use a special icon (for a product / event / campaign) we recommend using Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) formats only. By not using the traditional pixel-based formats (.GIF .PNG .JPEG) you ensure a high quality display at any screen depth (e.g., HD / Retina / UHD).
