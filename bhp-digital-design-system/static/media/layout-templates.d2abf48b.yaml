  Be sure to install the latest CLI for respective framework if you haven't done so. That also means to get the latest Node or Yarn running your local machine as well.

  Open a console and change work path to template folder path.
  Run a command to install all dependencies:
  ````
  yarn install
  ````
  Run a command to start development server. Then you can add your components and debug now:
  ````
  yarn start
  ````
  When project is ready to deploy, run a command to compile:
  ````
  yarn build
  ````
  The name of the output folder is "build" which is located at the root of the template folder.
  When build finish, upload whatever in the build folder to your web server.
